    "    1. Bike 16808 has logged almost 8x as many hours as the next most used bike. This is an extreme outlier.\n",
    "    2. The average trip duration of a subscriber is roughly half of what a normal customer is.\n",
    "    3. Interestingly enough, in July data analyzed, they had inverse number of users. As customer usage peaked, subscriber usage fell.\n",
    "    4. Males make up 60% of the market.\n",
    "    5. Ages 36-39 ride the most miles.\n",
    "    6. Not much difference between start/end point stations."
